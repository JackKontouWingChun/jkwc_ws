Had a great day with my son (Jake Kontou), students and my Si Hing, Sifu Michael Street at Grandmaster Wan Kam Leung's seminar on the 23rd. 

Big thanks to Sifu Gary Mckenzie (Sifu Abdul Malik) for organising the event. 
Good to meet Sifu James Sinclair and Sifu Mark Phillips. Also was great catching up with my Kung Fu brothers which I haven't seen in many years.

Sifu Kola Fakimolu, Sifu Usama Michael Louison, Sifu Clive Potter, Sifu Anton Van Thomas, Sifu Barry Lewis, Sifu Spencer Devine, Sifu Kwesi, Sifu - Full respect to all. With great respect to Sifu Wan Kam Leung, a powerful man and a gentleman, god bless.
